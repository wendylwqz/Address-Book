## Brief Overview
This application allows users to add a location along with some specifications to their list 
of locations. specifications include; a **tag**, a category of some sort to organize different classes
of locations (want to go, favourites, foods, wheelchair accessible, smoke free, no pets, etc.), 
a **p.s.**, allows user to make notes of the place (rude manager, muddy grass so note to wear crocs, 
there's always a cute dog that roams around, etc.), a **rating**, allows user to rate the .... out of five
(food taste, price range, past experiences, etc.)

It is great for users that would like to save locations, it may be used as a simple reminder of the address,
a bucket list, favourite list, etc. 
<p> This project is of interest to me (the creator)  because I love to save places
and stay organized. It would be insanely cool to be able to make an application 
that works as desired.</p>
